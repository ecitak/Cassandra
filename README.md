# Cassandra
CRUD Operations in Cassandra NoSQL Database.
This is the official source code repository for Apache Cassandra database. Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, high-performance, and distributed NoSQL database. Its high scalability and high availability of data make it ideal for cloud applications.

# Properties
Apache Cassandra comes with many features:

Flexible data model: It uses a key-value model with data groups called column families, which provides a more flexible data model compared to relational databases.

High performance: Apache Cassandra is optimized for storing and processing data in large-scale and high-density environments.

High scalability: Apache Cassandra automatically handles data distribution among nodes of the database cluster, increasing the system's horizontal scalability.

High availability: Apache Cassandra offers multi-node replication to prevent data loss, helping to maintain high availability.
